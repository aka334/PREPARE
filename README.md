PREPARE Challenge - Phase 2: Model Arena (Social Determinants Track)
Advance algorithms and analytic approaches for early prediction of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias based on social determinants of health, with an emphasis on explainability of predictions. [Model Arena - Social Determinants Track]
Overview
Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) are a set of brain disorders affecting more than 6 million Americans. Early intervention is crucial for successful disease modification, but detecting early signs of cognitive decline and AD/ADRD remains challenging. Current clinical methods often lack the sensitivity needed for early prediction, especially in underrepresented groups.

The objective of this challenge track is to improve early prediction of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) using social determinants of health. Through this initiative, the National Institute on Aging (NIA) aims to improve accuracy across diverse populations and explore understudied factors that may indicate early AD/ADRD.
